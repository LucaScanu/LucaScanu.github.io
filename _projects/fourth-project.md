An app grouping the best 25 surfing location in the world which visualises the location on a map and gives real-time info about the local weather. I have used a Node/Express.JS framework, Bcrypt, JWT for authentication, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap for the front end. I have integrated the app with a Google Maps API and a weather API.
