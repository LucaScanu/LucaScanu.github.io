The app aims to bring people together based on their mutual appreciation for an event or type of music, etc. This is a MEAN app as we used MongoDB as our NoSQL database, Express.js as our backend framework, AngularJS, HTML and SCSS for the front end and a Node.JS environment. I primarily focused on front end authentication with Angular.JS, UI design and SCSS styling.
