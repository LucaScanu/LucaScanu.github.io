I have been living in London for the past 18 years and during this time I have always worked in the hospitality
industry which, amongst other things is a very sociable industry aimed at bringing people together. However,
after many years doing this, and having experienced running my own business, I decide I wanted to do
more with my life and my career. As I have always been interested in technology and the web, it’s something
I’ve wanted to work within, but never had the opportunity. Discovering the Web Development Immersive at
General Assembly made me realise that dream was possible. I enjoy the creative and collaborative side of the
coding community and the seemingly limitless potential of coding languages. In my spare time, I try and solve
as many problems as I can on Code Wars, Free Code Camp and Exercism. Moving forward I’d like to work in a team of like-minded people to continue learning and create beautiful and useful apps.
